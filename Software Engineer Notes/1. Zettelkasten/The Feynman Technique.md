# The Feynman Technique

# 1. Take something you want to understand

# 2. Write out an explanation as if you were teaching it to someone who didn't understand the subject

# 3. Whenever you get stuck, go back to the material and re-learn. Fill in the gaps in your knowledge until you can write an explanation `without` source material
