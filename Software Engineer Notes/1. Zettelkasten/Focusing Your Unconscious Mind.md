# Focusing Your Unconscious Mind

## Start with the big picture
* What is going on with the concept?
* The big picture puts everything into context
* A simple explanation is a big picture idea

## 3 Step process

### 1. Pick a detail to learn
### 2. Understand it in context
* As you expand on a detail, ensure you understand every step of how it fits together
* You know that the black box works, you can ignore everything that you have abstracted
* If we just assume everything works inside the box, everything outside of the box should make sense, even though you don't know how it works
* I should understand why we do each step and the point of everything
* Ensure that you understand the purpose of each thing
* You don't need to learn all the details yet
* Each step can be broken down until each step is so simple, you don't need to break it down any further
### 3. Understand it by itself
* Figure out the rest ( abstracted, details unknown)
* #### Care
* Better memory/more insights/easier time
* Be passionate about the concept or care about the end result
* It should bother you that you don't understand a concept
* Care about the problem enough to make it the main focus of your brain
* Force your brain to care and it will solve it for you
* #### Point = Problem
* What is this piece about?
* What does it accomplish/describe?
* What does it do?
* You should understand the problem
* Deep & insightful regarding the problem
* #### Try to solve the problem yourself
* #### Look at examples and try and reverse-engineer the rule
* Problem > idea 1 > idea 2 > idea 3
* Hints help with your thinking on more details
* How the solution solves the problem?
* How it fits into the big picture?
* What insights it offers for the rest of the concept?
* What inspired that solution? (the steps to come up with it)
### 4. Reinforce it
* #### Invent
* Try to invent the concept for yourself
* #### Practice
* Apply the concept to various things
* Apply this concept wherever you can
* Expand on the concept
* Think about why it fits, put it in context
* This forces you to view the concept from different angles
* #### Explain
* Understand it well enough to explain to someone else
* Write it in your own words
* Explain every detail
* If you get stuck, you should fix your understanding
* Explaining is nice because it forces you to look for a simple way of viewing the concept
* #### Explore
* Think about various ideas related to the concept
* Mentally explore variations of the concept
* Why?
#### 5. Magic/Black box
