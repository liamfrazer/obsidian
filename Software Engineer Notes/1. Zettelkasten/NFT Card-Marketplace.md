# NFT Card-Marketplace

* Marketplace for NFTS via an app
* NFT would appear as a card but can be used as a battle pet idea
* NFT would have stats and owner tied to the card
* Card can be levelled up within the game and then sold for a profit
* Different options can be chosen within the game to level up the card/NFT for different stats
* This can then be traded with a % of the card coming back as a profit to developers
* Stats are then tied to the NFT contract, giving the customer a free choice of what they want to do with it
	* Keep it, level it up, sell it or put it on the market place after grinding etc
* User gets a choice whether to convert their card/pet to an NFT or whether they want to play the game normally/trade normally
