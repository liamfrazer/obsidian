# Mindset of Successful Programmers

## Focus on Practice
* How quickly can I get to 10,000 lines of code, where every 1000 lines are better than the last 1000?
* Your code will always suck, may as well have fun
* You will never know enough, but that's okay
## Ego is the enemy
* Swallowing pride when doing HTML/CSS courses
## Get Comfortable being Uncomfortable
* Manage information
* Think from first principles
* Research and apply solutions
* `Change I can't do it to I can learn to do it`
## You will never be a master, but being a student is so much better
* Think > Code > Commit
* Apply programming concepts and improve
* I don't get it > let me build something > I get it now
## Expectations of a Junior Developer
* Know the first principles of a stack
* Know git fundamentals (pull, push, commit)
* Willing and actively seeking to learn
* Persistent with solo problem solving
* Never afraid to ask the question
