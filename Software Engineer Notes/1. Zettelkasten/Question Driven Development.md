# Question Driven Development
* Think of an end goal
* Break it down into a series of small questions
* Google your way to success
* Create several small projects using this method
## Where to find projects
* Prompt ChatGPT with "beginner problems in `language`" or "beginner exercises in `language`
## Why
* Coding needs to be fun, and only possible with a positive feedback loop
* Small problems flows into the brain, but not overflowing with information
* Small problems add up into full blown projects once pieced together

## 50 projects > Cloning websites
* Need a plan
* Splitting out a cloned website into smaller tasks then creates mini projects
* These can then be split down further into smaller parts, the buttons don't even have to have any functionality
* All problems can be broken down to the point where you've got the smallest problem, then you can google that

## Whenever doing a tutorial, write 3 tiny projects at the end of each section
* Example: If I've finished an form section, create 3 crappy forms to ensure I've learnt correctly
