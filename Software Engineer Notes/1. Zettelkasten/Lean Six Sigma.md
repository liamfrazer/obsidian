	* 
* Six Sigma History
	* Motorola extensively applied Six Sigma as a process management discipline
* Y = F(x)
	* A transfer function is a mathematical expression of the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a system
	* Y refers to the measure or output of the process
	* X's are factors or inputs that affect the Y
	* Measure  = on-time pizza deliveries
	* X = factors that heavily influence timely deliveries
	* Take all the different Xs, use data to confirm this is true
	* Goal is to eliminate the ones that don't have an impact on the output
	* This is going into Root cause analysis
* Methodology
	* Six sigma itself is the goal, not the method
	* Minimising the process variation
	* Shifting your process average so that it is centred between your customer's spec limits
