# Lean Six Sigma

* What is Sigma?
* What is Six Sigma?
	* Aspiration or goal of process performance
	* LSL 33.75 to USL 34.25  - Target within this area
* What is Sigma Level?
	* Measures how many sigma there are between process average and the nearest customer specification
	* Higher sigma level means a lower defect rate
	* 
* Six Sigma History
	* Motorola extensively applied Six Sigma as a process management discipline
* Y = F(x)
	* A transfer function is a mathematical expression of the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a system
	* Y refers to the measure or output of the process
	* X's are factors or inputs that affect the Y
	* Measure  = on-time pizza deliveries
	* X = factors that heavily influence timely deliveries
	* Take all the different Xs, use data to confirm this is true
	* Goal is to eliminate the ones that don't have an impact on the output
	* This is going into Root cause analysis
* Methodology
	* Six sigma itself is the goal, not the method
	* Minimising the process variation
	* Shifting your process average so that it is centred between your customer's spec limits
* DMAIC
	* Define
	* Measure
	* Analyse
	* Improve
	* Control
		* Rooted in the principles of a five-phase project
		* Each phase has a specific purpose and specific tools and techniques that aid in achieving the phase objects
* Define
	* Establish a solid foundation
	* Projects start with a current state challenge or problem that can be articulated in a quantifiable manner
	* It is not enough to just know the problem, you must quantify it and also determine the goal
	* Once Problems and goals are identified and quantified, the rest of the define phase will be about 
		* valuation
		* team
		* scope
		* project planning
		* timeline
		* stakeholders
		* Voice of the customer
		* Voice of the business
* Measure
	* Measure phase is to gather baseline information about the process
		* process performance, inputs, measures, customer expectations
	* You will seek to achieve a few important objectives
		* Gather all possible X's
		* Assess measurement system and data collection requirements
		* Validate assumptions
		* Validate improvement goals
		* Determine COPQ - Cost of poor quality
		* Refine Process understanding
		* Determine Process stability
		* Determine process capability
* Analyse
	* The analyse phase is all about establishing verified drivers
	* Use stats and higher-order analytics to discover relationships between process performance and process inputs
	* Establishes a reliable hypothesis for improvement solutions
		* Establish the Transfer Function Y = f(x)
		* Validate the list of Critical X's and impacts
		* Create a Beta improvement plan
* Improve
	* Make the improvement
		* Designing, testing and implementing your solution
		* Stat Proven Results from Active/Study
		* Improvement/Implementation Plan
		* Updated Stakeholder Assessment
		* Revised Business case with ROI
		* Risk Assessment/Updated FMEA
		* New Process Capability and Sigma
