# Variables

* A variable is a container for storing data.
* A variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains

## Declaration & Assignment
1. Declaration (`var`, `let`, `const`)
2. Assignment (`=` assignment operator)

* In programming, you want a variable to be descriptive of what it contains
* There may be times where you need to declare a variable, but assign a value later on

## Data Types
```javascript
let firstName = 'Liam';

let age = 21;

let student = true;

  

console.log(firstName); // Liam

console.log(age); // 22
console.log(student); // true
```
