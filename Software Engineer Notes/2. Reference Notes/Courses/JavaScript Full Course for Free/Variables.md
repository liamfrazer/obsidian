# Variables

* A variable is a container for storing data.
* A variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains

## Two steps
1. Declaration (`var`, `let`, `const`)
2. Assignment (`=` assignment operator)

* In programming, you want a variable to be descriptive of what it contains
* There may be times where you need to declare a variable, but assign a value later on

```js
let studentAge;
studentAge = 21;
console.log(studentAge); // 21
```

```javascript
let studantAge = 21;
console.log(studentAge); // 21
```

## Number Data Type

```javascript
et age = 21;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age); // 22
```

## String Data Type
