# Input Search Box Component

* Work on functionality first before CSS is applied
* With any feature we're building, we then understand the requirements of the feature

## input field
* We need an input field
* Every HTML tag is actually a react component that JSX has already included
* React uses className instead of class, this is a syntax exstension
* class is a protected keyword, so cannot be used in JSX


```javascript
<input className='search-box' type='search' placeholder='Search...'></input>
```
* With inputs, you typically have a change handler that combines into an input
* We're mainly looking for target within the event expression
