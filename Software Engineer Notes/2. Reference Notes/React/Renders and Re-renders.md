# Renders and Re-renders

* Runs the constructor first, classes will always run constructor first
* The constructor will initialise the state
* The render runs next and determines what to show, what the UI for the component is
* The next lifecycle is the componentDidMount, which then renders the initial UI within the DOM

* The initial state of the component is displayed, then runs componentDidMount



* Render gets called when we initlise the app with constructor, and then render gets called
* setState will trigger render from calling
* Components will also re-render when props changer
