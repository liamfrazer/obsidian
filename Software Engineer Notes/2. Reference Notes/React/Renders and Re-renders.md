# Renders and Re-renders

* Runs the constructor first, classes will always run constructor first
* The constructor will initialise the state
* The render runs next and determines what to show, what the UI for the component is
* The next lifecycle is the componentDidMount, which then renders the initial UI within the DOM

* The initial state of the component is displayed, then runs componentDidMount
